# Flutter live test 3

 

## Getting Started

Requirements:

●     The page should have a Scaffold as the root widget.

●     Inside the Scaffold, create an AppBar with the title "My Shopping List".

●     Below the AppBar, create a ListView widget to display the list of shopping items.

●     Each item in the list should be represented by a ListTile widget.

●     Each ListTile should display an icon on the left, followed by the name of the shopping item.

●     The list should have at least 5 shopping items.

●     Add appropriate padding, spacing, and styling to make the app visually appealing.

●     Use the IconButton widget to add an icon button on the AppBar. When pressed, it should display a Snackbar with the message "Cart is empty".
