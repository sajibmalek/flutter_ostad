Question

●     Create a screen to display a list of contacts.

●     The contact list should be populated with at least three contacts, including their names, email addresses, and phone numbers.

●     Each contact in the list should be represented as a ListTile widget.

●     Implement a tap gesture on each ListTile so that when a contact is tapped, a bottom sheet appears.

●     The bottom sheet should display the contact's details, including their name, email address, and phone number.

●     Ensure that the contact details are dynamically fetched from the tapped contact.

●     The bottom sheet should be dismissed when the user interacts with it.
